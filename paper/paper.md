# Summary

SMILES strings are a compact, powerful format for storing molecule data. They are widely supported and backed by an extensive realm of theory and software. However, the SMILES specification is not generally adopted in large molecular databases and is usually provided as a property of stored molecules.

# Statement of need

`SmilesDB` is a database and API that provides 5,479 SMILES strings for both small and complex molecules. It includes a web-based database UI and a free and open API. Each molecule includes its SMILES identifier as well as atom counts, bond counts, and other molecular information generated by RDKit.

`SmilesDB` was first designed as a result of a previous project's need for large numbers of proteins to test new algorithms in WolframLanguage. Importing SMILES strings into WolframLanguage is well-supported, so the project called for a database of SMILES strings. Finding a lack of such a database, `SmilesDB` was built with data from the `BindingDB` [@chembl] and the `ChemBL` [@bindingdb] databases. The SmilesDB has been archived to Zenodo [@Choi-Kim_2025].
