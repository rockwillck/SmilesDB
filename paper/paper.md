# Summary

`SmilesDB` is a database and API that stores 5,479 both small and complex molecules in the SMILES string format. It includes a web-based database UI and a free and open API. Each molecule includes its SMILES identifier as well as atom counts, bond counts, and other molecular information generated by RDKit.

# Statement of need

SMILES strings are a compact, powerful format for storing molecule data. They are widely supported and backed by an extensive realm of theory and software. However, the SMILES specification is not generally adopted in large molecular databases and is usually provided as a property of stored molecules.

`SmilesDB` was first designed as a result of a previous project's need for large numbers of proteins to test new algorithms in WolframLanguage. Importing SMILES strings into WolframLanguage is well-supported, so the project called for a database of SMILES strings. Finding a lack of such a database, `SmilesDB` was built with data from the `BindingDB` [@chembl] and the `ChemBL` [@bindingdb] databases. Storing molecules in SMILES strings enables a total database size of under 2 megabytes. The SmilesDB database and server code has been archived to Zenodo [@Choi-Kim_2025].

# Available Data
Each molecule in `SmilesDB` includes data from RDKit [@rdkit] as well as a SMILES string identifier. The full database can be queried using the online API at [smilesdb.org/api](https://smilesdb.org/api) with a variety of dynamic endpoints for any number of molecules.

## Usage
`SmilesDB` can be queried in any language capable of sending http requests, including WolframLanguage [@wolframInterface], JavaScript, and Python.
